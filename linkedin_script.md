### [0:00 - 0:30] Introduction (What is this?)
**(Action: Start with your face visible on the main screen of the app.)**

**Narration:**
"Hi everyone! I want to show you a project I built to solve a really annoying problem: hiring.
Imagine you get 100 applications for a job. Reading all of them takes hours, right? MOST of that time is spent just checking if they have the basic skills.
So I thought: 'Why am I doing this? Computers are great at sorting things.'
That's why I built the **Resume Classifier**. It’s a tool that reads resumes for me, so I don't have to."

### [0:30 - 1:15] The "Manual Mode" (How it thinks)
**(Action: Click on "01. CONFIGURATION" -> "MANUAL".)**

**Narration:**
"Let me show you how it works.
First, I can tell it exactly what I'm looking for. Let’s say I need someone who knows Python and SQL, and has 5 years of experience."

**(Action: Type "Python, SQL" and "5" into the boxes. Click "INITIATE ANALYSIS".)**

**Narration:**
"I click analyze, and instantly—it tells me: 'IT Ready'.
It didn't just guess. It looked at the skills I typed and compared them to thousands of examples it has learned from. It’s like a very fast, very focused assistant."

### [1:15 - 2:00] The "Upload Mode" (The Real Magic)
**(Action: Go to "UPLOAD" tab. Drag and drop a PDF file.)**

**Narration:**
"But here is the really cool part. I don't want to type stuff in. I just want to upload a file.
I’m grabbing a real PDF resume here.
When I drop it in, the computer actually reads the document. It ignores the fancy fonts and colors and just looks for the important stuff: What skills do they have? What did they study?"

**(Action: Point to the result showing 'IT Classified'. Hover over the "Accuracy" number.)**

**Narration:**
"See that? Ideally, it matched perfectly. And look at the accuracy score at the bottom. That number tells me how confident the computer is. It’s checking its own work!"

### [2:00 - 2:30] Why This Matters
**(Action: Look at the camera. Stop clicking.)**

**Narration:**
"So, why does this matter?
Because reading one resume takes a human about 14 minutes.
This tool does it in seconds.
That means recruiters can stop being 'document readers' and start being 'people connectors'. They can spend their time actually talking to candidates.
I built this because I love solving real problems. I’m currently looking for a role where I can build powerful tools like this for your company. If you want to hire a developer who focuses on saving you time and money, send me a message. Let’s work together."

### Tips
- **Speak Clearly:** Don't rush.
- **Smile:** When you say "It’s a tool that reads resumes for me," smile like it's a huge relief.
- **Keep it Simple:** Don't use words like 'Algorithm', 'Neural Network', or 'Latency' unless you explain them instantly.
